## Title of the Project
HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES
## About
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating advanced methods for early detection and prevention. This project focuses on developing a robust heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, the system aims to accurately classify patients' risk levels based on their medical history and diagnostic data.
